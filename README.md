# Data-Driven Football Scouting: A Strategic Analysis of Right-Winger Targets

### A Project for Borussia Dortmund (2016/17 Season)

## üéØ Objective

This project simulates a real-world data analysis task for a top-tier football club. The scenario is the end of the 2015/16 season, where Borussia Dortmund, under Head Coach Thomas Tuchel, faces the critical challenge of replacing key players, most notably the Bundesliga's top creator, Henrikh Mkhitaryan.

The objective is to leverage a comprehensive football dataset to conduct a data-driven scouting process, moving from a broad market analysis to a specific, evidence-backed player recommendation that aligns with the coach's unique tactical philosophy.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **End-to-End ETL Process:** Data extraction from raw CSV files, cleaning and transformation with Pandas, and loading into a relational MS SQL Server database.
